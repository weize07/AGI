Current Challenges

* Transfer learning: Unable to transfer representation to most reasonably
related domains except in specialized formulations.
* Understanding: Lacks “reasoning” or ability to truly derive “understanding” as
previously defined on anything but specialized problem formulations.
(Definition used: Ability to turn complex information to into simple, useful
information.)
* Requires big data: inefficient at learning from data
* Requires supervised data: costly to annotate real-world data
* Not fully automated: Needs hyperparameter tuning for training: learning
rate, loss function, mini-batch size, training iterations, momentum,
optimizer selection, etc.
* Reward: Defining a good reward function is difficult.
* Transparency: Neural networks are for the most part black boxes (for realworld
applications) even with tools that visualize various aspects of their
operation.
* Edge cases: Deep learning is not good at dealing with edge cases.
